# Password Safe
We create this project as a school project. It will be a simple password manager with focus on saving passwords secure with encryption. 
## Concept

We have a login page, where the user, which is already registered, can login with his email and password. 

This password is hashed and stored. 

If the user is login, he is redirected to the dashboard, where he can add - view - edit - delete, credentials regarding to an account or website. 
A record contains: 
- Email
- Username
- Password 
- Website URL
- Notes

## Thoughts
Caesar encryption and move amount is sum of ascii value of every character in password. 

### Authentication

User has to login with email and password. 


### Storing passwords
